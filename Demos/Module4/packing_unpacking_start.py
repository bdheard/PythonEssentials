# packing and unpacking.
#

# A sample python function that takes three arguments and prints them
def fun1(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)
 
# This is an example of PACKING. All arguments passed to fun2 are packed into tuple *args.
 
    # Convert args tuple to a list so we can modify it
 
    # Modifying args
 
    # UNPACKING args and calling fun1()
 
# Driver code
