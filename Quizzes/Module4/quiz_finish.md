# Module 4 Quiz

*What is the slice expression that gives every third character of string s, starting with the last character and proceeding backward to the first?*

1. [ ] s[::-3]
1. [ ] s[-1::-3]
1. [ ] s[:0:-3]
1. [ ] s[-1:0:-3]

**Explanation:**
The third index in the slice expression is -3, which indicates every third character stepping backward.

The first and second indices should be -1 (the last character) and 0 (the first character). Either of these can be allowed to default.
