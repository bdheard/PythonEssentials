## History

- Invented in the Netherlands, early 90s by Guido van Rossum
- Named after Monty Python
- Open sourced
- Designed to be human readable
- Scalable, object oriented and functional from the beginning
- Active community

## Installing Python

- Python is pre-installed on most Unix systems, Linux and MAC OS X
- The pre-installed version may not be the most recent one
- Download from http://python.org/download/
- Python comes with a large library of standard modules

::: notes

## Running Python

- Considered a scripting language, but is much more
- Python interpreter evaluates each expression
- Python also has mechanisms to allow a python program to act both as a script and as a module to be imported and used by another python program

## Python Programming Language

- Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers.
- An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it.
- A compiler reads the program and translates it completely into an executable before the program starts running.
- Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.
