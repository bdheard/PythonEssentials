## Python Programming Language

- Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
    - Interpreters: Reads a high-level program and executes it.
    - Compilers: Translates program into an executable before it is run.
- Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.
